# Microservices Architecture Project

## Overview

This project is a culmination of the knowledge and skills acquired from a comprehensive <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react">Udemy course</a> by Stephen Grider. It focused on architecting large, scalable applications using a collection of microservices. It demonstrates the ability to deploy multi-service applications to the cloud with Docker and Kubernetes, solve concurrency issues in a distributed systems environment, and leverage JavaScript skills to build a complex web application, among other capabilities.

### What This Project Demonstrates

- Architecting scalable apps using microservices.
- Deploying a multi-service app with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Solving concurrency issues in distributed systems.
- Building a Server-Side Rendered React App to render data from microservices.
- Sharing reusable code between multiple Express servers using custom NPM packages.
- Writing comprehensive tests for each service.
- Communicating data between services with an event bus.
- Writing production-level code, with no shortcuts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Databases:** MongoDB, Redis
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes
